            <p>We are all senior IT students at the University of Massachusetts Boston. In our free time, we enjoy a multitude of different activities.
                When we were discussing what ideas to come up with for our senior project we noted that keeping track of finances was difficult.
                At one point or another, all of us wondered how much money we had to spend on personal expenses after paying for the necessities such as tuition, rent, car payments, and others. And thus the idea for the "Student Saver" was born. </p>
